Hi, it's me!
The maintainer of [JavaParser](http://javaparser.org/) :-)
We've got all kinds of ways to communicate to users,
but I was missing a simple way to post some notes,
some snippets of code,
maybe a note on a new feature,
the kind of stuff that is not worth a chapter in [the book](https://leanpub.com/javaparservisited),
but might be useful.

That's why I set up this blog.
Now I can litter the web with parsing stuff :-)
